# MyMap
MyMap lets users create their personal trip maps, where they can save locations along with descriptions and personally chosen icons. It might in time include support for toggling weather report data, and automatically tracking one's trip.

MyMap is designed to work with the [MapBack](https://github.com/datalowe/mapback) API. It uses [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) for delivering WebView-based Android/iOS applications.
